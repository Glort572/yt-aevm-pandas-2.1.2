# Python YouTube API to update metadata

Just some Python files which can help you update the metadata (i.e. title, description, tags) in all your YouTube videos **without wasting time**.

I recommend watching [Federico's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6_sJ1y5NJ8) to understand how it works before using it.

## NOTE
This code was originally written by [Federico Tartarini](https://github.com/FedericoTartarini/youtube-api-edit-videos-metadata).
I updated it (with the help of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), and it works, yay!) in order to be compliant to the 2.1.2 version of the pandas library.

This Python file, along with the rest of the repo, isn't protected by any kind of copyright. However, if you modify the code and publish it, we would like to see proper credit.

To conclude, there are some screenshots of the conversation between me and ChatGPT if you're curious enough to see how I managed to make it work.
